Question-



Given a boolean expression s of length n with following symbols.
Symbols
    'T' ---> true
    'F' ---> false
and following operators filled between symbols
Operators
    &   ---> boolean AND
    |   ---> boolean OR
    ^   ---> boolean XOR
Count the number of ways we can parenthesize the expression so that the value of expression evaluates to true.

Note: The answer can be large, so return it with modulo 1003

Example 1:

Input: 
n = 7
s = T|T&F^T
Output: 
4
Explaination: 
The expression evaluates to true in 4 ways ((T|T)&(F^T)), (T|(T&(F^T))), (((T|T)&F)^T) and (T|((T&F)^T)).
Example 2:

Input: 
n = 5
s = T^F|F
Output: 
2
Explaination: 
((T^F)|F) and (T^(F|F)) are the only ways.
Your Task:
You do not need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function countWays() which takes n and s as input parameters and returns number of possible ways modulo 1003.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n3)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n2)

Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 200
